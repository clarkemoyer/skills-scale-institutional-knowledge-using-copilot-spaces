# OctoAcme — Project Initiation Guide

**Navigation**: [← Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) | [Next: Planning →](octoacme-project-planning.md)

## Purpose
Define the initial steps to validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan.

## When to use
Whenever a new project idea or feature proposal is ready to be explored.

## Goals
- Confirm business need and measurable outcome
- Identify stakeholders & champions
- Define success criteria and initial timeline
- Decide go/no-go for planning

## Minimum Deliverables
- Project One-pager (Problem, Goal, Success Metrics)
- Stakeholder list & communication plan
- High-level timeline and key milestones
- Initial risk list
- Resource needs (team roles, rough effort estimate)

## Project One-pager Template
- Project name:
- Problem statement:
- Objective / Goal (SMART):
- Success metrics:
- Primary stakeholders:
- Suggested timeline / milestones:
- Quick risks & dependencies:
- Proposed team / roles:

## Initiation Checklist
- [ ] One-pager completed and reviewed by Product Lead
- [ ] Sponsor / Stakeholder alignment (email or meeting)
- [ ] Decision: Approve to move into planning?
- [ ] Create repo or project board skeleton
- [ ] Add initial artifacts to repo (docs/ or .copilot/)

## Decision Gate
Move to planning when:
- Success metrics are clear
- Stakeholders agree on priority
- Team availability is confirmed
- Sponsor has approved the project to proceed

**Decision Makers**: Product Manager (recommend), Stakeholders (input), Sponsor (approve)

## GitHub Setup During Initiation
- [ ] **Create GitHub repository** (if new project) or identify existing repo
- [ ] **Set up GitHub Project board** with initial columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Review, QA, Done)
- [ ] **Create initial documentation** in `docs/` folder:
  - Add Project One-pager (problem, goals, metrics, timeline)
  - Add stakeholder list and communication plan
- [ ] **Create Copilot Space** (if using) and link to relevant process docs
- [ ] **Add initial Issues** for key work items identified during initiation
- [ ] **Set up labels** for the project (feature, bug, documentation, blocked, etc.)

## Risk Assessment in Initiation
Even in the early stages, identify potential risks:
- **Technical risks**: Unknown dependencies, unproven technology, integration complexity
- **Resource risks**: Team availability, skill gaps, competing priorities
- **Schedule risks**: Aggressive timeline, external dependencies, unclear scope
- **Business risks**: Changing requirements, stakeholder misalignment, regulatory concerns

Document these in the initial risk list and reference in the Project One-pager.

## Handoff to Planning
When the decision gate is passed, the Project Manager schedules a planning kickoff and ensures:
- The Project One-pager is shared with the delivery team
- GitHub Project and repo are accessible to all team members
- Key stakeholders are invited to the planning kickoff
- Initial risks and dependencies are documented and ready for planning discussion
